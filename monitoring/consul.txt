Consul


Discovery means connections bettewen diffrent microservices 

Its an infrastructure layer that facilitates application communications
it can work as a DNSto find the resources your application needs.
It can be used as a transport via encrypted tunnels for your dynamic applications
Blocked applications can use consul tunnels. Consul provides service discovery and application configuration.
Consul monitors application health and can redirect traffic from faulty applications
Platform agnostic

if service A wants to connect to service B, it connects through a hardcoded IP address to Service B's load balancer which puts it to single point of failure, doent mtter if there are multiple instances of service B 
It also adds network latency and service A has to go through load balancer

Three pillars of service mesh 

Discovery
configuration
segmentation -

Registry - all instances get resisterd to a registery .
configuration- key value pairs to manage instances centraly 
segmentation- connect - service graph - who cab connect to what .

In kubernetes, consul is added as statefull set in all nodes in the cluster
