Monitoring Concepts
<ip>:3000/metrics - gives metrics

Pains of pull based system
Nagios is also a pull base system - very hard to scale
Prometheus is a pull based system but easier
Pull based system updates every 15 seconds/periodical so it is not live

Push based system takes lot of work/hard to set up and is better for huge infrastructure spread across the world
Push based also have quality and scaling issues.
Push is better for event based monitoring and greater modularity
Push based system will send information when an event completes, its on the end point when to send the data


Dont try to fit your needs to a tool, find a tool according to your infrastructure needs
dont jump from tool to tool, add tools when needed
dont build what you can buy or download for free and write extensions to the extending tools you can use when something is lacking 
dont manualy add targets to your monitor system, use some form of service discovery 
dont repeat same troubleshooting tasks again and again, review runbooks to see where repeated tasks can be automated
everyone should monitor insted of one person's job and should be considerd from begining of the project
